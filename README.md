### The project
This is an exercise project to practice SwiftUI. I've took a publicly available design from a behance.com and created an app from it.

I see this as the best way to practice new language.

### The design

### The license
I don't care, done it for fun and practice, with no commercial plans or plans whatsoever. I'll most likely loose interest to it the moment I finish it.
